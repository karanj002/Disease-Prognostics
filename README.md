# Disease-Prognostics
## Predictive Healthcare System with Machine Learning
This project focuses on developing a user-friendly system for analyzing patient data and predicting potential illnesses using machine learning techniques.

### Project Overview
The system leverages Python libraries like TensorFlow and Tkinter to provide the following functionalities:

1. **Data Ingestion and Exploration:** Reads patient data (e.g., demographics, medical history, lab results) and utilizes libraries like DTale for interactive exploration, allowing users to gain deeper insights into their data.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** Cleans, prepares, and transforms patient data into a format suitable for machine learning models. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features based on domain knowledge.
3. **Machine Learning for Prediction:** Trains two powerful algorithms - decision trees and random forests - using TensorFlow. These models identify patterns in patient data that correlate with specific illnesses, enabling prediction of potential health risks.
4. **User Interface:** Implements a user-friendly Tkinter interface for easy data input and visualization of predicted illness probabilities. Users can seamlessly interact with the system to understand their health risks.

### Technologies Used
* Python (main programming language)
* TensorFlow (machine learning framework)
* Tkinter (GUI development for user interface)
* DTale (interactive data exploration library)
* Pandas (data manipulation library - likely used)
* Scikit-learn (may be used for decision tree and random forest implementation)
